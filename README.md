### Base Carousel

### Infinite Loop Carousel

Seamlessly cycles through content with no visible start or end. Ideal for testimonials, partner logos, or any continuously rotating content.

Designed for media-rich content with a sidebar navigation showing all items. Perfect for video playlists, image collections, or any scenario where users need to see and jump to specific items.

### Insta Slide
